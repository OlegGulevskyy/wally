# Wally - Desktop app

## About

This is a toy project to build a Desktop cross-platform application, that serves as unofficial Pexel.com client. This allows you to browse images, preview them and set them as Desktop wallpapers, without the trouble of downloading each image, and manually set it up as wallpaper. 

## Features

- Save your own API key to the app settings to make the calls
- Use query / keywords to browse images from Pexel.com - free and high quality images
- Preview individual image
- Set individual image as wallpaper (tested on MacOS, Ubuntu 22.04)
- Infinite scroll of images (as long as Pexel.com provides results, the end result is not tested)
- Light / dark modes (saved to the app config and will be persisted on app reuse)
- Shortcuts support - Ctrl (CMD on MacOS) + K to focus the main query input / Esc to loose focus

## Features possible plans

- Check the API key requests limits and display in the app UI
- Ability to select which screen to set the wallpaper for (multiscreen support)
- More shortcuts support (i.e. settings menu)
- More settings options (images to fetch per request, gallery layout, filtering)
- Save images to favourites
- Create albums of images
